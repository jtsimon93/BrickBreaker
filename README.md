# Brick Breaker

A brick breaker game written in C++ using Raylib.

## Building the Game
All dependecies are handled as Git submodules. Init and pull the sub modules, then you can build the game using the included CMake configuration. The CMake configuration also handles web builds using Emscripten but you will need to have Emscripten already installed onto your computer.
